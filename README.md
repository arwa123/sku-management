# sku-management
in memory sku managent service


Design and code catalog management system for a generic ecommerce site to store
various kinds of SKUs(Stock keeping unit). Expected functionalities of the systems are
1. Provide basic CRUD operations to store, update and delete SKUs from the store
2. Provide search functionality to find products based on a keyword which can be in the
title or description of the SKU.
Note:
Use in-memoery data structures to store the SKU information and to do the search
operation. Avoid using databases like Mysql, elasticsearch etc.
